# Chance Games

## Description
This is a collection of a few simple gambling games. Being the first project that I have made with Python, there is a lot that will/has been learnt. 

The games include:
1. Coin Toss
2. Dice Roll
3. High Card

## Features
The game will have a persistent account, allowing players to "log in" and use their money over time.
